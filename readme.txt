My project is to design a Scrabble Helper.
It has various options that users can choose to help them better play the Scrabble Game.
For the programming part, I first created a Scrabbler class in Scrabbler.py.
The classes have various functions that enable the Scrabble Helper to do various tasks.
For the User Interactive part, I created another Application class in GUI.py.
Users can make choices on the graph.
The function controller in Application class is the key to link Scrabbler class and the GUI.
